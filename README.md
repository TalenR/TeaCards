# TeaCards
Tea Company Art Redistribution Standard

This project is intended to simulate the card game called TeaCards. The instructions to the game will be provided 
when the code is playable. 

The project is currently contained entirely in structures.py and tests.py
The other files are very old non-working models.

The project requires no non-standard python modules.
